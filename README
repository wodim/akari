Akari Endl√∂sung is basically a Twitter and Telegram bot that searches for
images using the Bing API and generates a captioned picture which is then
posted.

On Twitter, people can ask for captioned images that are generated on the fly.
The bot also generates new images every twenty minutes based on the most
popular tweet that it has seen in that timespan using a rather simple algorithm
which still deserves some improvements.

On Telegram, the bot can also be asked to generate images, but it does not
send images automatically or anything like that.

This codebase also features a few other goodies such as:
* Basic rate limiting, using Redis
* Translation API, not used at the moment
* Follows and unfollows people automatically, ignoring obvious spammers
* Can send mails using Mailgun (currently used for stuff that needs to be fixed
  manually, i.e. when the Twitter account is suspended)

At this point the bot is pretty resilient to abuse and is proven to be very
stable.

The objective of the bot was to create a new version of @i_akari_daisuki, this
time in Spanish. I didn't want the bot to do anything else, but the ability to
request new captions by its followers turned out to be pretty popular, so it
was left on. This is probably the most distinctive feature of the bot, and it
receives dozens of requests daily, which in turn are usually retweeted,
making the bot gain even more followers.

Installation
------------

First: this bot works with Python 3 only. And the Telegram bot uses asyncio,
so it needs Python 3.5.

There's a requirements.txt file, so to install the required modules from PyPI,
you just need to:

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

In turn, you'll need imagemagick, and also a Redis server. The Redis server is
used for rate limiting of requests and of "out of service" mails sent.

Rate limits are important for the Telegram bot: on Twitter it's
hard to spam the bot because Twitter itself will throttle you, but there's no
limit in the amount of messages you can send to the bot on Telegram, so if you
don't want to have Redis, you might as well not use the Telegram bot.
Rate limits are also applied on Twitter, but they are much "softer".

The Twitter bot also mails you in case it's failing to connect to Twitter,
which happens when the account gets locked. Mails are rate limited, so Redis
is necessary for this too.

You'll need to copy config.ini.skel to config.ini and populate it, the
settings are explained inside the file as comments.

About the crontab:

*/20 * * * * from akari import akari_cron; akari_cron()
Every twenty minutes, generate a new caption based on the last tweets.
Those tweets are stored in pending.txt. The file is emptied once a new caption
has been successfully published.

*/15 * * * * from followers import follow_my_followers; follow_my_followers()
Every fifteen minutes, check for new followers, and then follow them back.

0 6 * * * from followers import unfollow_my_unfollowers; unfollow_my_unfollowers()"
Every night at 6:00, check for users I follow but who no longer follow me back
and unfollow them.

0 6 * * * find akari_endlosung/images -type f -delete
Every night at 6:00, empty the images folder. Images are *not* automatically
removed after being posted.

Also, you'll need a process control system that automatically launches both
bots, deals with the logs, and re-launches the bots should they crash.
I use supervisord, for which I provide a supervisor.ini file you can drop in
/etc/supervisor/conf.d/, but if you want you can also use upstart or systemd.
